# Course 3 - Optimisation

Optimisation of convex problems with continuous variables can be performed using the `cvxpy` package. Integer, binary, and mixed problems can be solved by `cvxpy` only if the `cvxopt` package is also installed. These packages can be installed as follows:

```
python -m pip install -U pip
python -m pip install cvxpy
python -m pip install cvxopt
```
