In this section we consider sequential prediction, in particular how well a GP can predict future tide heights given only historical data, by restricting the data available to the GP in different ways. Initially we consider sequential prediction with a fixed lookahead period, $t_{\text{lookahead}}$, in which the prediction at any time $t^*$ uses only training data with input time values less than or equal to $t^* - t_{\text{lookahead}}$, such that predictions at subsequent values of $t^*$ use progressively larger datasets. The results of sequential predictions with lookahead periods of 5 minutes and 50 minutes using GP sum\_opt are shown in figures \ref{fig:5 min fixed lookahead} and \ref{fig:50 min fixed lookahead}, demonstrating the model's ability to make predictions at a fixed time period in the future. As shown in the figures, for larger $t_{\text{lookahead}}$, the predictions become more noisy, especially at earlier values of $t^*$.

Lastly, we consider future predictions in which the size of the subset of data on which the GP is conditioned remains fixed, using data points whose time values are between $t=0$ days and some limit $t_\text{lim}$ to form the entire predictive distribution, and consider how that predictive distribution as a function of time varies with $t_\text{lim}$. Figures \ref{fig:0.1 day preds} and \ref{fig:1 day preds} show the predictive distribution of sum\_opt as a function of time for $t_\text{lim}=0.1$ days and $t_\text{lim}=1$ days respectively, with the region $\left[0, t_\text{lim}\right]$ on the time axis shaded in blue. As shown in the figures, for $t_\text{lim}=0.1$, the predictive distribution is highly uncertain, but for $t_\text{lim}=1$, the predictive distribution for all future days has reasonably high accuracy and calibrated uncertainty, given that sum\_opt has only oserved one day's worth of data. These statements could be quantified by considering how the RMSE and LPL on unseen ground truth data vary as a function of  $t_\text{lim}$, however this is left as a direction for future work. Animations of GP predictive distributions for varying $t_\text{lim}$ are included in the GitHub repository for this project\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jakelevi1996/aims/tree/main/scripts/course_1_dei}}, in particular for GPs \href{https://github.com/jakelevi1996/aims/blob/main/scripts/course_1_dei/Results/Protected/sequential_predictions_sqe_opt.gif}{\color{blue}{sqe\_opt}}, \href{https://github.com/jakelevi1996/aims/blob/main/scripts/course_1_dei/Results/Protected/sequential_predictions_prod_opt.gif}{\color{blue}{prod\_opt}}, and \href{https://github.com/jakelevi1996/aims/blob/main/scripts/course_1_dei/Results/Protected/sequential_predictions_sum_opt.gif}{\color{blue}{sum\_opt}}.
